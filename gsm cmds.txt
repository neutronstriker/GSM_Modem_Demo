note at has always to be written before + so i just skipping it for simplicity:-

to query network registration 
+CREG?

to register to a particular network
+Creg = 0,0,"network code " or check datasheet

to disable or enable netwrok
+cfun=0 and +cfun=1 respectively

to turn off device 
+cpof

to make a call
atd<number>;

to hang an incoming call 
ath

to answer an incoming call
ata

to hang an dialed call
ath1 or ath

to set the message in text mode or hex mode cmd is
+cmgf=1 or +cmgf=0 respectively 

//note hex mode means all data is converted to hex mode characters but if you interpret it
//using a microcontroller whatever data you will actually get will be in ascii characters only but will be using only 0 to 9
//and A to F characters only

to receive a messsage properly i.e. directly to the serial port instead of getting saved in sim or eeprom
we may need to issue and additional command depending on device
+cnmi=2,2,0,0,0  or +CNMI = 2,2,0,0 //new message indication format

to set msg storage memory
at+cpms = "SM" for sim card
check data sheet for other storage variables.

to query number of message stored in sim and memory capacity
at+cpms?

to store/save all changed settings in device
+csas //note settings may be saved in sim or device eeprom depending on device and sim capability

to restore all saved settings
+cres

to send a message
+cmgs="<ph number>" <cr> <type message> <ctrl+z> //note the setting selected for text mode or hex mode using +cmgf also affects this

to read a message stored in memory either device or sim(selected by +cpms)
+cmgr=<index> //where index is a number like 1 or 2 or 3  etc

to list messages stored in memory selected by +cpms
+cmgl=<message type>

//message type can take any of these values

Text mode    PDU mode  Status of messages
possible     values     possible values in memory

“REC UNREAD”  0          received unread messages
“REC READ”    1          received read messages
“STO UNSENT”  2          stored unsent messages
“STO SENT”    3          stored sent messages
“ALL”         4          all messages


to show incoming call number all with "RING" ascii
+clip=1 to show and +clip =0 to not //this setting is not getting saved so we should run this command once every startup
//it also show the contact name if it is saved in the sim

to give ussd commands like to check balance or request operator for info
+cusd=1,"<the code i.e *123# >,15 //this is the format
